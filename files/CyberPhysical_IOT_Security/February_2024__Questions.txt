On both first calls of 23/24 and 24/25 the questions were

- What are the functions of the Can controller?
Answer using definition, so send serial bits and talk with the processor

- Bus off attack: why attacker doesn’t go to passive error mode?
Because it decrease its error counter after the victim goes to error passive mode (correct)
Because it decrease its error counter after the victim goes to error active mode
Because during the first phase a message gets correctly transmitted so TEC = TEC - 1

- what is the Dominant bit voltage in CAN-bus?
The bit is zero and its voltage is high (3.5 v and 1.5 v respectively) (correct)
The bit is one and its voltage is high (3.5 v and 1.5 v respectively)
The bit is zero and its voltage is low (2.5 for both ends)

- Considering Optical flow, what does the attacker exploit?
The attacker exploits the optical flow assumption which is that the ground is stationary (correct)
The attacker exploits the optical flow assumption which is that the ground is moving

- What is a PLC?
Answer using definition, so specialized computer used to automate functions

- Question about DIS and DIO packets in an IOT network
The correct answer was the one that said “triggers the sending of DIO packets”

- (IOT security) Consider the ⁠aes-ctr. How does block counter work to increase security?
The correct answer was “block counter is increased every time to use multiple nonce values”

- What is ⁠soft gps spoofing?
Answer using definition, so “the drone gradually locks to the spoofed gps signal”

- In a ACC scenario, an attacker can
Answer using definition, so “create a spike in the signal to make a vehicle accelerate”

In a closed control loop
- The reference value is compared with the process value (correct)
- The reference value is compared with a value not generated by the process
- There’s no need to compare values
