To verify you have been successful, try to run you attack and, from another machine, try using the
ping command. When doing so, try to ping:
- A non existing host on the internet (i.e., 1.2.3.4)
- A non existing host on the LAN (e.g., 10.9.0.99)
- An existing host on the internet (8.8.8.8)
For each of the cases, justify your results.

When pinging 1.2.3.4

--- 1.2.3.4 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 received, +5 errors, 0% packet loss, time 4007ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 17.279/23.736/34.804/5.927 ms

I receive all the packets but with a destination port error, because the port was not set by the program
using the TCP() layer of scapy.



When pinging 10.9.0.99
root@6bbe7f658dbc:/# ping 10.9.0.99 -c 10
PING 10.9.0.99 (10.9.0.99) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- 10.9.0.99 ping statistics ---
10 packets transmitted, 0 received, +10 errors, 100% packet loss, time 9197ms
pipe 4

I get a dst host unreachable with 100% packet loss. This is because since the destination IP is inside the same network
the ARP protocol is used to get the MAC address of the host but since our spoof
program doesn't handle this, we will get this error



When pinging 10.9.0.5
root@6bbe7f658dbc:/# ping 1.9.0.5 -c 10

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 20.706/31.486/63.692/16.308 ms

Since this host exists I dont have problems with the ARP protocol because the real host replies,
but I have the same problem as the first case because the ICMP port is closed
