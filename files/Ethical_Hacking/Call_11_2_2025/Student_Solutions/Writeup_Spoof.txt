What would you do to improve the attack efficacy?
(You only need to give the idea in the writeup, implementing it is not mandatory)
I would try to execute more instances of the synflood.py program by using threads,
parallelizing the workload. With the same idea it would be better to execute the same program
on multiple machines to maximize damage
