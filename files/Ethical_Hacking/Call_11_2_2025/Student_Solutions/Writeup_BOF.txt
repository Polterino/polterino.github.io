Once you complete the missing parts, execute the attack using: “cat badfile | nc 10.9.0.5 ****”.
How did you found the values of the missing fields?
Where can you find the result of this attack?

The port is the one the server is listening to, so nc 10.9.0.5 9090
The result is printed by the server, which prints the buffer address and frame pointer
To check if the file has been created, we can use the reverse shell and send a ls command


1) Provide the address you used and the steps you made in order to successfully execute the attack and write into the file.
I used 10.9.0.1 and port 9090 because I was listening with nc -lnv 9090
After the reverse shell worked:
I checked if the file existed using ls
I used echo bof attack successful > bof_exploit.txt
And to check if the write was successful, cat bof_exploit.txt
2) What is the purpose of the ‘-i’ parameter in the executed command?
To make the bash shell interactive and receive the output when you send an input such as ls
3) How would you write inside the generated file without having the reverse shell?
Using the same principle used when creating the file
So after sending
touch bof_exploit.txt
I would send 
echo bof attack succesfull > bof_exploit.txt
through the exploit
