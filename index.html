            <h2>Understanding Quiz Results</h2>
            <p>If a question has a green checkmark, it means that the answer the site gives as "correct" is 100% correct, because it has been verified. However, if there is a yellow warning sign, it indicates that the marked answer may not be correct, although it is likely to be so. Please pay attention to these symbols when reviewing your quiz results.</p>
